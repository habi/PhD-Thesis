\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I thank Prof.\ Dr.\ Johannes C.\ Schittny for giving me the opportunity to carry out this work at the Institute of Anatomy at the University of Bern. Johannes introduced me into the delicate details of lung morphology, physiology and development and also provided multiple enjoyable moments away from the lab routine. Dr.\ Miguel González helped me to get on track with various image processing intricacies and was---after his  change from the \href{http://www.istb.unibe.ch/}{ISTB} to \href{http://www.alma3d.com/en}{Alma IT Systems} in Spain---substituted by Dr.\ Mauricio Reyes from the Institute for Surgical Technology \& Biomechanics, University of Bern. Both Miguel and Mauricio deserve thanks for their guidance as co-referees of this work. Prof.\ Dr.\ Marco F.M.\ Stampanoni, head of the \acs{TOMCAT} beamline at the \acl{SLS} and assistant Professor for X-ray Microscopy at the Department for Information Technology and Electrical Engineering of the ETH in Zürich not only acted as secondary co-referee of this work, but also was an invaluable resource on all things tomography and x-rays, provided well founded critique for my work and helped me to brush up my Italian skills both written and spoken. Prof.\ Dr.\ Martin Frenz acted as my Tutor for the Graduate School for Cellular and Biomedical Sciences of the University of Bern. Already during my Master Thesis I had the pleasure to work under the guidance of  Martin and I am thankful for his watching eye as a Tutor on this Thesis.

Both Sébastien Barré and Lilian Salm shared the office with me during the last months at the Institute of Anatomy and contributed to the pleasant atmosphere in our group. Sébastien was a helpful partner in discussing MATLAB problems and keeping awake during the beamtime shifts at \acs{TOMCAT}. Mohammed Ouanella was always an expert help with the preparation of the samples and also provided excellent food from his home country, Algeria. Thanks! Prior members of our group, Dr.\ Sonja Mund and Bettina de Breuyn also receive my gratitude for the time they shared in our group

The whole staff at the Institute of Anatomy provided for a great time; special thanks go to Dr.\ Stefan Tschanz for uncondicional help with all things IT and for putting up with my special wishes concerning the use of our infrastructure. Chrigu Lehmann had to put up with lathe machining \SI{0.6}{\milli\meter} Epon samples before we switched to paraffin embedded ``big'' lung samples and was also provided generous help with some special mechanical tasks like a riveting a broken buckle back to my ski boots. Therese Dudan as a secretary always provided one of the first friendly smiles in the morning when I came in to pick up our mail.

Special thanks go to the whole team at the \acs{TOMCAT} beamline at the \acl{SLS} of the Paul Scherrer Institut in Villigen. Marco Stampanoni always provided a pleasurable work environment. Dr.\ Christoph Hintermüller was not only a great guidance during my Master Thesis for the postgraduate course in Medical Physics but provided expert support at the beamline and countless interesting discussions, both scientific and completely non-scientific. Xris' insight into scripting, UNIX commands and image processing was a great help. Without the work of Dr.\ Federica Marone on the tomographic reconstruction algorithms and implementation of those algorithms at the beamline most of the pretty images in this work would not have been possible.

Both the University sports Berne and the Velokurier Bern provided me an athletic balance to the time spent at the desk in front of my monitors.

My friends Pesche, Bruni, Wöufu, Sigi and Nicola provided for (sometimes much needed) diversion from the academic cruft and shared loads of lunchtimes. Thanks!

Without my family I would not be where I am today. Mom, Dad and Nina, I'll always
be grateful to all of you.

Nina \graffito{Note that both my sister and girlfriend share the same first name, but are different persons.} Hostettler makes me happy. I love you!
