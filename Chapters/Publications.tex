\myChapter{Publications}\label{ch:publications}
The three chapters \ref{ch:xrm2008}, \ref{ch:tsuda2008} and \ref{ch:haberthuer2010} of this document are verbatim copies of publications I have authored or collaborated on. They represent the published results achieved during the time frame of this thesis.

In chapter~\ref{ch:XRM2008} contains a proceeding that has been published in the Conference Series of the \href{http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/}{Journal of Physics} after the 9\textsuperscript{th} \href{http://xrm2008.web.psi.ch/}{International Conference on X-Ray Microscopy} in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland. In this manuscript we presented a method for localization and three-dimensional imaging of sub-micron sized gold particles in rat lungs. Two batches of gold particles with sizes of \SI{200}{\nano\meter} and \SI{700}{\nano\meter} have been applied to rat lung samples through intratracheal instillation. The samples have been scanned with high resolution \ac{srxtm} at the \ac{tomcat} beamline of the \ac{sls} with a voxel size of \SI{350}{\nano\meter}. This resolution was sufficient to detect the exact three-dimensional localization of single and clustered gold particles with a size of \SI{700}{\nano\meter} in alveoli, alveolar ducts and terminal bronchioli in the rat lung samples.

After scanning the samples at \ac{tomcat} we analyzed physical sections using \ac{tem} to verify the locations of the gold particles using a commonly accepted method. We were expecting to be able to correlate between both the virtual sections of the tomomraphic dataset and the real sections imaged through \ac{tem}, but were surprised how accurately we were able to correlate betwen the two imaging modalities. As expected, the particles with a diameter of \SI{200}{\nano\meter} were smaller than the detection capabilities of \ac{tomcat}, so we were only able to localize them using \ac{tem}.

The combination of both imaging modalities made it possible to obtain the full
unrestricted 3D access using \ac{srxtm} and to verify the localization of the particles in the 3D-space with very high resolution using \ac{tem}.

Chapter~\ref{ch:Tsuda2008} presents a new image processing method for accurate three dimensional reconstruction of the gas exchange retion of the lung. The method has been  published in the \href{http://jap.physiology.org/}{Journal of Applied Physiology} and is based on a \ac{fe} analysis of the tomographic datasets recorded at \ac{tomcat}. 

The datasets have been segmented using an iteratively determined threshold, which was chosen to match morphological parameters of the resulting three dimensional reconstruction with the same morphological parameters of the lung samples. The structural parameters of the lung samples have been previously determined using classical stereological\graffito{Stereology is used for extracting quantitative information about a three-dimensional sample from measurements made on two-dimensional sections of the material}\todo{other explanation of ``stereology'' in one sentence. with citation?} methods.

In this work we have been able to highlight numerous advantages of a three dimensional analysis of the reconstructions over traditional stereology. One of the most fundamental advantages of the tomographic analysis is the non-destructice method of obtaining the informations. Using traditional methods, the sample has to be sectioned, which essentially destroys the integrity of the sample. Using the tomographic dataset, a thorough analysis of the inner structure of sample can also be carried out on slices, but these slices are virtual. These virtual slices through the dataset also offers another advantage; slices can be generates in arbitrary direcions through the sample as long as needed, and interesting regions can be iteratively improved. See the discussion in chapter~\ref{ch:discussion} for additional advantages\todo{acinus detection \threed, marking in \twod makes it ``more understandable'' than on classic slices.}.

Chapter~\ref{ch:Haberthuer2010} presents a method to increase the field of view of synchrotron radiation tomographic microscopy while keeping the advantage of a high resolution, something which is generally not possible with such an increase in the field of view. The work presented in this chapter started out of a need in our group. We noticed that the functional lung unit---the socalled acinus---seems to be growing to a larger extend than previously described \todo{citation?} and needed a method to easily cover a larger field of view with the tomographic reconstructions of our samples obtained at \ac{tomcat}.

Since the smallest structures we need to unambiguously detect are the alveolar septa with a thickness of several micrometers, we need to obtain tomographic scans with large magnifications, \ie\ high resolution in the order of one micron. Additionally, we strive for a large field of view to visualize an entire acinus. Usually, a large field of view resulting in a large sample volume can only be acquired with low magnification and vice-versa. To overcome this limitation the method presented in this chapter was implemented as a proof of concept during my master thesis of the \href{http://www.biomed.ee.ethz.ch/nds/}{MAS ETH in Medical Physics} at the \ac{psi} \cite{Haberthuer2008c}. In the following months, the method has been refined into a sanning method at \ac{tomcat} and is now routinely applied to obtain tomographic datasets of rat lung samples with both large field of view and high resolution.

Additionally---through optimization of the acquisition protocol---the radiation dose inflicted on the sample can be greatly reduced, which is a first step towards in-vivo \ac{srxtm} at \ac{tomcat}. This paper has been published in the \href{http://journals.iucr.org/s/}{Journal of Synchrotron Radiation}.
