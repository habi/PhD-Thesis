The tomographic images used in this work have served as a common ground truth to obtain insights into the mammalian lung. Morphometric parameters of the terminal airways obtained on three-dimensional reconstructions of tomographic data have been used to examine structural parameters of the gas-exchange region in rat lung samples.

The developed wide field scanning method is used for routine measurements in our group. The current workflow used custom MATLAB-scripts for the merging of the projections from the several obtained subscans. The goal for the next few months is the integration of the wide field scannig method in the image processing pipeline~\cite{Hintermueller2010} of the \acsu{tomcat} beamline, especially into the software used to convert the projections to sinograms \verb+Prj2Sin+. \verb+Prj2Sin+ already integrates the standard \SI{360}{\degree} off-center sample rotation method to double the horizontal field of view (as shown in \autoref{subfig:wfs360}). For such a scan all projections are acquired in one sequence, and through relatively simple re-ordering of the projections on the disk \verb+Prj2Sin+ can compute the overlap between the images and calculate the merged sinograms. For a \ac{wf-srxtm} scan as presented in \autoref{ch:haberthuer2010} we generally acquire three separate subscans in three different directories. Stitching the projections directly with \verb+Prj2Sin+ instead of performing the overlap-search, reading and merging the original projections and writing the merged projections to disk prior to the generation of merged sinograms would greatly speed up the process.

At the moment, the merging of one dataset with in total \num{10734} takes a bit more than one hour to perform with the MATLAB-scripts. Integrating the workflow into the image processing pipeline would both decrease the time used for merging these wide field scans by avoiding multiple reading and writing circles to disk and make the whole process available to other users of the beamline. The work in the next few months will focus on the integration of the process in the beamline workflow, first preliminary efforts have already been completed.

Nonetheless of these unresolved small issues, the feasibility of the enlargement of the horizontal field of view of tomographic endstations has been demonstrated and the resulting datasets have been used for the analysis of large volumes of the terminal airways with ultrahigh resolution. Future work will focus on the use of \ac{wf-srxtm} dataset for the extraction and analysis of the acini, as presented in \autoref{subsec:stereological analysis}. The presented method which uses so-called manhole covers to separate single acini from a central airway has been applied to multiple rat lung datasets over the course of the postnatal development from day 4 to day 60. The definition of the location of the manhole covers in the airway tree is a process relying on manually locating the position of the junction in the airway based on morphological criteria---the changes in the airway wall---and subsequently drawing the manhole cover at that location. Using the airway structure obtained from a prior skeletonization process as a guideline for the placements of these manhole covers is planned for the future. Such a guideline would both speed up the process of locating the exact positioning of the manhole covers and reduce the needed a priori morphological knowledge of the airway tree.

Using a combination of the manhole cover method for separating the acini with the skeletonization of the airway tree would make it possible to extract and segment large amounts of acini for the analysis in relatively short time. Currently achieved results hint towards a larger change of the acinar size during lung development than previously assumed\todo{or is it simply that the segmentation at D60 is not as easily possible? or do we really have much larger acini than at D36?}\todo{Citation about acinar size change?}.

Additionally, we plan to use the obtained \ac{wf-srxtm} datasets for the extraction of larger regions of the terminal airways than previously available. These extracted regions will be used to improve currently available models of airflow inside the terminal airways \cite{Sznitman2007,Sznitman2009} \todo{What about ``Sznitman, Sutter, Altorfer, Tsuda, Stampanoni, Roesgen \& Schittny.
