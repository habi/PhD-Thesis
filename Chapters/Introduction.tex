\todo{Comprehensive introduction into the field}
Seeing and observing the object of interest has always been a crucial part of medical and biological research. If not by the naked eye, the object has been studied with ever-increasing resolution. In biomedical research, state of the art imaging methods include light and electron microscopy\todo{Referenzen}. Even higher resolutions, down to \SI{10}{\nano\meter} \todo{how much?} can be reached with x-ray microscopy.

\section{High resolution imaging}
One of the main problems with light and electron microscopy is the destructive sample preparation. For both methods, the sample has to be sectioned in thin slices\todo{wie dünn genau?}. This process destroys the three-dimensional structure of the sample and makes is very time consuming to reconstruct the three-dimensional placement of the slices to extract the structural information. \citet{Woodward2005}~\todo{Moar?} have shown that a three-dimensional reconstruction of parts of the gas exchanging region of the avian lung is feasible, but the process is both extremely time-consuming and needs very precise registration of the stack of slices cut from the sample. An exception to the destructive sample preparation is offered by confocal microscopy\todo{Citation?}. In confocal microscopy, light originating from outside the focal plane is excluded using a spatial pinhole. This allows for the definition of a section through a sample thicker than the optical focal plane of the objective. By positioning the focal plane stepwise through the whole sample, the three-dimensional information of the sample can be obtained. This method obviously only works with translucent samples.

In contrast to this, tomographic imaging makes it possible to non-destructively study the three-dimensional structure of a wide variety of samples. Two-dimensional projections of the sample can be taken fairly easily using a multitude of methods (e.g.\ X-Ray, light, Infrared\todo{true?}). These two-dimensional images include partial three-dimensional information of the sample volume which has been transversed in the projection. If several projection images are acquired from different directions through the sample, the full three-dimensional information can be obtained. Using computed tomography\todo{cite Hounsfield}, a three-dimensional representation of the sample can be reconstructed and obtained. The theory and concepts behind the tomographic reconstruction are explained in more depth in chapter~\ref{ch:ct}.

\section{Outline of the Thesis}
Main goal of the PhD-Thesis.

This thesis is structured into the following parts:

\begin{itemize}
	\item [Part \ref{part:introduction}] contains this introduction and gives a short overview over the lung development in chapter~\ref{ch:lung}. Chapter~\ref{ch:ct} explains the most important concepts in computed tomography and gives a short description of the \acf{tomcat} beamline, where all high resolution tomography experiments of this work have been performed.

	\item [Part \ref{part:results}] contains publications written during the time of my Ph.D.\ Thesis at the Institute of Anatomy.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item [Chapter~\ref{ch:XRM2008}] consists of a proceeding written for the 9\textsuperscript{th} \href{http://xrm2008.web.psi.ch/}{International Conference on X-Ray Microscopy} in Zürich, Switzerland, from the 21\textsuperscript{st} to the 25\textsuperscript{th} July 2008. This proceeding describes a method to precisely localise instilled sub-micron sized gold particles in rat lungs through a combination of high resolution synchrotron radiation tomographic microscopy and \acl{tem}.
		\item [Chapter~\ref{ch:Tsuda2008}] consists of a paper submitted to the \href{http://jap.physiology.org/}{Journal of Applied Physiology} in which a new image processing method for accurate three dimensional reconstruction of the gas exchange region of the lung is presented. This method is based on a finite element analysis of datasets obtained with high resolution synchrotron radiation tomographic microscopy.
		\item [Chapter~\ref{ch:Haberthuer2010}] presents a method to increase the field of view of synchrotron radiation tomographic microscopy while keeping the advantage of a high resolution, something which is generally not possible with such an increase in the field of view. Additionally---through optimization of the acquisition protocol---the radiation dose inflicted on the sample can be greatly reduced.
	\end{itemize}
	\item [Part \ref{part:discussion}] contains two chapters with an overview over the obtained results and an outlook on further work based on this thesis.

	\item [Part \ref{part:back matter}] finishes this thesis with the necessary documents for the \href{http://www.gcb.unibe.ch}{Graduate School for Cellular and Biomedical Sciences}, the bibliography and an index\todo{do we have an index?}.
