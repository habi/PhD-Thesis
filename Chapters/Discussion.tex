The application of tomographic imaging permits an unprecedented insight into the mammalian lung. Tomographic imaging enables us to see and observe the object of interest to gain insight into the details of the sample to be studied. Besides the pretty images of the beautiful biological samples which spur the interest in this line of work, biological question can be scientifically answered using tomographic images as a base.

The tomographic data obtained at the beamline for \ac{tomcat} offers an unmatched high-resolution three-dimensional insight into the mammalian lung. Even if higher resolution images of the terminal airway ends than the ones obtained at \ac{tomcat} have been obtained with \ac{sem}, these images only provide a view of the surface structure of a sample as shown in \autoref{fig:sem} and are not suited for a full three-dimensional reconstruction of the terminal airway ends. Using \ac{sem} or \ac{tem} it is impossible to visualize the larger three-dimensional structure of the terminal airway ends inside the lung since the sample has to be cut prior to acquiring images using this method, which essentially destroys the full three-dimensional information of the sample. Using \ac{em}-tomography, ultra high three-dimensional information from a sample can be obtained, but the available sample volumes of maximally \SI{64}{\micro\meter\cubed} and generally around \SI{1}{\micro\meter\cubed} (personal communication with Dr.\ Dimitri Vanhecke\graffito{For a review on \ac{em} tomography see \cite{Lucic2005}}) are much too small for the structural analysis of the terminal airway ends.

Tomography in contrast offers a non-destructive insight into the lung, tomographic microscopy using \ac{uct} enables the study of the major airways of swine~\cite{Litzlbauer2006}, rat~\cite{Langheinrich2004a,Sharif2010} or mice lung~\cite{Langheinrich2004,Ritman2005} and while \ac{srxtm} and \ac{wf-srxtm} enable the study of the functional lung units of the lung, the so-called acini with unmatched resolution and precision.

In this work three imaging methods based on ultra high resolution tomographic data of the terminal airway have been presented, the following sections discuss the major notable points of each of them.

\section{Multimodal Imaging}\label{sec:multimodal imaging}
The method presented in \autoref{ch:xrm2008} combines the advantages of tomographic imaging and \ac{em} into a multimodal imaging approach for the analysis of inhaled particles in the lung. The tomographic data provides the unrestricted three-dimensional information on the location of sub-micron particles in the terminal airway tree which is combined with the extremely high resolution of the \ac{em}-images for the precise analysis of those particles in the lung tissue.

Exposure to ultra-fine particles and nanoparticles produces by environmental or industrial sources is an important health problem. It is expected that inhaled particles are deposited in specific locations in the lung\todo{Citation! Evtl.\ Christian MÃ¼hlfeld or Barbara Rothen? $\rightarrow$ bug JCS!}. With currently available methods, the exact location of these deposition sites in relation to the airways tree cannot easily be analyzed. 

Classic histological sections analyzed using light and electron microscopy allow for a precise location of the inhaled particles in relation to the tissue, \ie make it possible to analyze the interaction of the particles with alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells~\cite{Muhlfeld2008}. But the precise localization of these interaction sites inside the airway tree are impossible to extract using histological sections since the three-dimensional structure of the sample is destroyed.

Registration of classic histological sections with the three-dimensional data obtained through \ac{srxtm} make it possible to localize sites of interaction along the airway tree inside the three-dimensional structure of the terminal airways. The method presented in \autoref{ch:xrm2008} was only little more than a proof of concept in terms of the registration between the two imaging modalities. Careful alignment of the sample prior to physical sectioning made registration straightforward, since the images only needed to be corrected for rotation and translation to be able correlate between a physical slice imaged using \ac{em} and a virtual slice of the \ac{srxtm} dataset.

\autoref{fig:correlation} shows the three-dimensional situation of different alignment situations of the two multimodal datasets. The situation shown in \autoref{subfig:correlation-planar} can be achieved through careful alignment of the sample prior to histological sectioning and corresponds to the situation presented in \autoref{ch:xrm2008}. The fully unrestricted three-dimensional information of the airway tree can be matched with highest resolution two-dimensional information about the particle location in or around the tissue in the lung.

\autoref{subfig:correlation-arbitrary1} and \ref{subfig:correlation-arbitrary3} depict situations where the two datasets are arbitrarily orientated with one or multiple degrees of rotation, respectively.

Current work in our group focuses on an automatic registration method taking into account all six degrees of freedom \ie rotation and translation in the x, y and z-plane. First results have already been presented as a master thesis by SÃ©bastien \citet{Barre2009}.

\section{Finite element reconstruction of the terminal airways}
The results presented in \autoref{ch:tsuda2008} focus more on the structural analysis of the gas-exchange region of the lung. The alveolar structure of the pulmonary acinus plays a vital role in gas exchange function. Using an analytical method which mapped a \ac{fe} representation of the terminal airways over a three-dimensional reconstruction of a \ac{srxtm} dataset we accurately reconstructed the gas exchange regions of the lung in three dimensions with ultra high resolution of \SI{1.48}{\micro\meter} per voxel.

To our knowledge the structure-function relationship of the parenchymal region of the lung has never before been three-dimensionally analyzed in such detail. \citet{Berend1991} performed an analysis of the peripheral region of one human lung using serial sections studied by light microscopy. They were able to analyze the structure of one partial acinus through formidable effort and stated that the process proved to be very difficult and time consuming. \citet{Litzlbauer2006} analyzed porcine lungs using \ac{uct} but suggest to favor \ac{srxtm} over \ac{uct} to enhance the quality of morphometric analysis of the terminal airway structure.

Using \ac{srxtm} it has not only been possible to visualize the alveolar region of rat lung samples, but also to assess and match morphological parameters of the computed three-dimensional reconstruction to prior stereologically assessed parameters of these lungs.

Since the reconstructed datasets have been directly elementalized using a \ac{fe} mesh lung tissue and air spaces were not only visualized three-dimensionally, but also immediately prepared for further analysis of the terminal airway region. Different morphological parameters were assessed and the \ac{fe} meshing prepared the resulting dataset for subsequent \ac{cfd} analysis of the airflow in the lung.

\section[WF-SRXTM]{Wide field synchrotron radiation based x-ray tomographic microscopy}
The \ac{wf-srxtm} results presented in \autoref{ch:haberthuer2010} make it possible to image much larger lung samples than with conventional \ac{srxtm}. Prior to the presented \ac{wf-srxtm} scanning method, obtaining tomographic datasets of entire acini in the lung relied on luck, with the increase in field of view tomographic images of full acini in the terminal airways can be routinely obtained. Since the results presented in \autoref{ch:haberthuer2010} almost exclusively focus on the engineering and technical background of the method, I would like to additionally highlight biological results achieved applying \ac{wf-srxtm} on rat lung samples in the following sections of this chapter instead of an additional discussion of the method.

We routinely performed more than 70 \ac{wf-srxtm} scans of different rat lung samples. Using a region growing algorithm multiple independent airway segments have been extracted from those datasets and the structure of these airway segments has been visualized using a skeletonization algorithm built into MeVisLab~\cite{Bitter2007}, the development environment for medical image processing and visualization which I have been using almost exclusively for the analysis and visualization of the tomographic datasets during my work.

\subsection{Skeletonization}
A skeletonization of a structure is performed to extract the underlying information of said structure. The skeleton of a structure corresponds to the local maxima of the distance transformation of this structure, which transforms a binarized image into an image where each pixel gray value corresponds to the distance of this pixel to the nearest boundary. \autoref{fig:skeletonization} explains the whole process in a two-dimensional example. An in-depth explanation of the skeletonization algorithm built into MeVisLab is presented by \citet{Selle2002}, an application of the algorithm for the morphometric quantification of vessels is presented by \citet{Boskamp2004}.

MeVisLab can export the information of the skeleton to an \acsu{xml}-file from which we can obtain the amount of skeleton nodes and their position in space for further analysis. The example in \autoref{fig:skeleton} shows a successful three-dimensional skeletonization of multiple acini in a rat lung sample obtained at postnatal day 21 containing multiple airway segments which each contain one or more acini. Both these structures are shown in the background. The foreground of the image shows the extracted skeletons containing between \num{1100} and \num{7300} nodes.

Extracting the independent airway segments as shown in \autoref{fig:skeleton} would not have been possible using classic tomography at \ac{tomcat}. Enhancing the field of view of the tomographic scans enabled the visualization of multiple acini in the lung and made additional results possible; a stereological analysis of the \ac{wf-srxtm} datasets is presented in the following section.

\subsection{Stereological analysis of the tomographic data\label{subsec:stereological analysis}}
As mentioned in \autoref{ch:introduction}, the interrelation of the acini in the lung tissue cannot be analyzed using classical sectioning methods, since the three-dimensional information of the airway structure is destroyed. Using a region growing method multiple independent airway segments were extracted from the three-dimensional \ac{wf-srxtm} datasets.

Using a method coined \emph{man hole covering} the airway segments have been subdivided into single acini, \ie the entrance of the acinus or the border between the purely conducting and the gas-exchanging region has been closed. 

Using morphological criteria like appearance of alveoli in the airway walls, the above mentioned border has been identified and so-called manhole covers have been manually drawn over the tomographic slices. 

\autoref{subfig:manhole-3d} shows a three-dimensional overview of 6 acini segmented using this manhole cover method. The red rings show the location of four manhole covers, the other covers are not visible in this view. \autoref{subfig:manhole-804} and \ref{subfig:manhole-1168} show slices from the original \ac{wf-srxtm} dataset overlaid with the individual segmented acini. These slices have then subsequently been used for the morphological analysis as described below. The white square in the middle of the images shows the field of view of a tomographic image obtained with classical tomography at \ac{tomcat} image, the semitransparent white circle marks the region of usable data from the reduced field of view. It is clearly visible---even if the sample does not completely fill the field of a \ac{wf-srxtm} scan and could have been bigger---that the usable volume is greatly increased.

The covers used to segment the visible acini are hidden by the shown segments. \subref{subfig:manhole-804} and \subref{subfig:manhole-1168}: Slice 804 and 1168 of the \ac{wf-srxtm} dataset, respectively. Both slices are slightly cropped in horizontal direction. The white square marks the field of view from a classic \ac{srxtm} scan at \ac{tomcat}. The increase in field of view is immediately evident. The regions of the red, cyan, yellow and blue acinus outside the square would not have been detected using a classic scan, but are included in the \ac{wf-srxtm} dataset.}

The acini segmented as described above have been overlaid over the tomographic data (as shown in \autoref{subfig:manhole-804} and \ref{subfig:manhole-1168}), which made it possible to easily understand the interrelation of the acini even on the two-dimensional slices. 

\autoref{ch:haberthuer2010} presents a method to increase the field of view of tomographic imaging in horizontal direction, for the analysis of multiple acini in our lung samples we needed to increase the field of view in vertical direction, too. To achieve this, we performed a so-called stacked wide field scan, where multiple \ac{wf-srxtm} datasets are sequentially recorded on top of each other, so that the resulting total dataset covers an increased field of view in horizontal and vertical direction. Using a python script at the \ac{tomcat} beamline, all the necessary subscans for the lateral increase in field of view have been recorded for each vertical position, making an un-attended tomographic batch scan of greatly increased sample volume possible. The subsequently presented analysis was performed on such stacked \ac{wf-srxtm} datasets with a size of approximately 3000$\times$3000$\times$3000 voxels at an isometric voxel size of \SI{1.48}{\micro\meter}.

\subsubsection{STEPanizer}\label{sec:stepanizer}
Tomographic data obtained at \ac{tomcat} is inherently isotropic, \ie the voxel have an equal side length and are small cubes. This makes tomographic data well suited for morphological analysis using a stereological approach, even if stereology and tomography completely differ in their approach of obtaining a description of the three-dimensional characteristics of the studied sample.

Using tomographic slices of rat lung samples obtained at different postnatal days we assessed the number of alveoli per volume of the segmented acini. Using the aforementioned manhole cover method in a custom MeVisLab-Network, several acini have been three-dimensionally extracted and overlaid over the two-dimensional tomographic slices, as shown in \autoref{subfig:manhole-804} and \ref{subfig:manhole-1168}. The volume of the extracted acini which are shown in \autoref{subfig:manhole-3d} has been calculated according to the voxel size.

Using a beta-version of the STEPanizer~\cite[available \href{http://stepanizer.com/}{online}]{Tschanz2010}, the number of alveoli per acinar segment has been counted. The STEPanizer is a simple, web-based tool for manual stereological assessment of digital images developed by Dr.\ Stefan Tschanz at our institute. The beta-version of the STEPanizer with enabled disector\graffito{A physical disector consists of two parallel histological sections generated a known distance apart from the same tissue block. An optical disector is generated by focusing a known distance through the z-plane of a thick section; \eg parallel focal planes using high numerical aperture microscopy objectives, confocal microscopy or tomographic imaging~\cite{Hsia2010}. Since tomographic images are inherently isometric, adjacent slices can be used for disector-type analysis.} was used to count the appearance or disappearance of septal bridges in the tomographic datasets. Counting these septal bridges correctly estimates the amount of alveolar entrance rings which in terms corresponds to the number of alveoli in the volume. Details on the counting process have been described by \citet{Hyde2004} and \citet{Ochs2004}.

Using the number of bridges and the volume of the alveolar segments, the alveoli per volume have been plotted as shown in \autoref{fig:alveoli per volume plot}. A statistically significant increase of the alveolar number per volume is observed until postnatal day 21,  until day 60 we subsequently detected a significant decrease in alveolar number per volume. Generally, stereological data should be presented as number per unit \eg alveoli per single acinus or alveoli per lung.

Nonetheless we have shown that applying a well-described stereological method, the optical disector \cite{Hsia2010} to tomographic data yields the results closely comparable to results obtained from classic histological sections. Lilian Salm, a Master-Student in our group used a newCAST \todo{correct? citation? or do we just link to \url{http://www.visiopharm.com}} system for the analysis of alveolar numbers on samples comparable to the samples shown in \autoref{fig:alveoli per volume plot}; the obtained results from tomographic data and classic histological slices are within their respective standard deviation (personal communication).

The stereological evaluation of parameters on tomographic data offers an increased insight into the structure of the lung. Using classic histological sections a correct assignment of the different alveoli to their appropriate acinus is not possible while a three-dimensional region growing segmentation of the acini makes this task easily feasible. Not only is an unrestricted three-dimensional view of the resulting segments possible, but further analyses can be carried out on exported two-dimensional slices.
