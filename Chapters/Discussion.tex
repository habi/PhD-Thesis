The application of tomographic imaging permits an unprecedented insight into the mammalian lung. It enables us to see and observe the object of interest to gain insight into the details of the sample to be studied. Besides the vivid images of the beautiful biological samples which spur the interest in this line of work, biological questions can be scientifically answered using tomographic images as a basis.

The tomographic data obtained at the beamline for \ac{tomcat} offers a three-dimensional insight into the mammalian lung with extremely high resolutions of up to \SI{370}{\nano\meter} voxel size. Even higher resolution images of the terminal airways than the ones obtained at \ac{tomcat} have been obtained with \ac{sem} but these images only provide a view of the surface structure of a sample as shown in \autoref{fig:sem} and are not suitable for a full three-dimensional reconstruction of the terminal airways. Using \ac{sem} or \ac{tem} it is impossible to visualize the larger three-dimensional structure of the terminal airways inside the lung since the sample has to be cut prior to acquiring images using this method, which essentially destroys the full three-dimensional information of the sample. Using \ac{em} tomography, ultra high three-dimensional information from a sample can be obtained, but the available sample volumes of maximally \SI{64}{\micro\meter\cubed} and generally around \SI{1}{\micro\meter\cubed} (personal communication with Dr.\ Dimitri Vanhecke\graffito{For a review on \ac{em} tomography see \citet{Lucic2005}.}) are too small for the analysis of the terminal airway structure and the volume of rat lung acini which are known to be around \SI{1.9}{\milli\meter\cubed} \cite{Rodriguez1987}.

In contrast to \ac{tem} and \ac{sem}, computed tomography offers a non-destructive insight into the lung, tomographic microscopy using \ac{uct} enables the study of the major airways of swine~\cite{Litzlbauer2006}, rat~\cite{Langheinrich2004a,Sharif2010} or mice lung~\cite{Langheinrich2004,Ritman2005}. \ac{srxtm} enables the study of the functional units of the pulmonary gas exchange area, the so-called acini with unmatched resolution and precision \cite{Tsuda2008}.

Three imaging methods based on ultra high resolution tomographic data of the terminal airway have been presented in this work, the following sections discuss the major notable points of each of them.

\section{Multimodal Imaging}\label{sec:multimodal imaging}
The method presented in \autoref{ch:xrm2008} combines the advantages of tomographic and electron microscopy imaging into a multimodal imaging approach for the analysis of inhaled particles in the lung. The tomographic data provides the unrestricted three-dimensional information on the location of sub-micron particles in the terminal airway tree which is combined with the extremely high resolution of the \ac{em}-images for the precise analysis of those particles in the lung tissue.

Exposure to ultra-fine particles and nanoparticles produces by environmental or industrial sources is an important health problem\todo{Citation?}. It is expected that inhaled particles are deposited in specific locations in the lung\todo{Citation! Evtl.\ Christian Mühlfeld or Barbara Rothen? $\rightarrow$ bug JCS!}. With currently available methods, the exact location of these deposition sites in relation to the airways tree cannot easily be analyzed. 

Classic histological sections analyzed using light and electron microscopy allow for a precise location of the inhaled particles in relation to the tissue, \ie make it possible to analyze the interaction of the particles with alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells~\cite{Muhlfeld2008}. But the precise localization of these interaction sites inside the airway tree are virtually impossible\graffito{Theoretically, a three-dimensional reconstruction of serial sections would be possible, but due to the enormous effort it can only be done for extremely small volumes, as described in \autoref{sec:high resolution imaging}.} to extract using histological sections since the three-dimensional structure of the sample is destroyed.

The registration of classic histological sections with the three-di\-men\-sion\-al
 data obtained through \ac{srxtm} makes it possible to localize sites of interaction along the airway tree inside the three-dimensional structure of the terminal airways. The method presented in \autoref{ch:xrm2008} was only little more than a proof of concept in terms of the registration between the two imaging modalities. Careful alignment of the sample prior to physical sectioning made registration straightforward, since the images only needed to be corrected for rotation and translation to be able correlate between a physical slice imaged using \ac{em} and a virtual slice of the \ac{srxtm} dataset.

\autoref{fig:correlation} shows the three-dimensional situation of different alignment situations of the two multimodal datasets. The situation shown in \autoref{subfig:correlation-planar} can be achieved through careful alignment of the sample prior to histological sectioning and corresponds to the situation presented in \autoref{ch:xrm2008}. The fully unrestricted three-dimensional information of the airway tree can be matched with highest resolution two-dimensional information about the particle location in or around the tissue in the lung.

\autoref{subfig:correlation-arbitrary1} depicts the situation where the two datasets are orientated with one degree of freedom in respect to each other, \autoref{subfig:correlation-arbitrary3} depicts the orientation situation with multiple degrees of freedom between the two datasets.

Current work in our group focuses on an automatic registration method taking into account all six degrees of freedom \ie rotation and translation in the x, y and z-plane. First results have already been presented as a master thesis by Sébastien \citet{Barre2009}.

\section{Finite element reconstruction of the terminal airways}
The results presented in \autoref{ch:tsuda2008} focus more on the functional analysis of the gas-exchange region of the lung. The alveolar structure of the pulmonary acinus plays a vital role for the gas exchange function. Using an analytical method which mapped a \ac{fe} representation of the terminal airways over a three-dimensional reconstruction of an \ac{srxtm} dataset we accurately reconstructed the gas exchange regions of the lung in three dimensions with ultra high resolution of \SI{1.48}{\micro\meter} per voxel.

To our knowledge the structure-function relationship of the parenchymal region of the lung has never before been analyzed in such detail in three dimensions. \citet{Berend1991} performed an analysis of the peripheral region of one human lung using serial sections studied by light microscopy. They were able to analyze the structure of one partial acinus through formidable effort and stated that the process proved to be very difficult and time consuming. \citet{Litzlbauer2006} analyzed porcine lungs using \ac{uct} but suggest to favor \ac{srxtm} over \ac{uct} to enhance the quality of morphometric analysis of the terminal airway structure.

Using \ac{srxtm} it has not only been possible to visualize the alveolar region of rat lung samples, but also to assess and match morphological parameters of the computed three-dimensional reconstruction to prior stereologically assessed parameters of these lungs.

Since the reconstructed datasets have been directly elementalized using a \ac{fe} mesh, lung tissue and air spaces were not only visualized three-dimensionally, but also immediately prepared for further analysis of the terminal airway region. Different morphological parameters were assessed and the \ac{fe} meshing prepared the resulting dataset for subsequent \ac{cfd} analysis of the airflow in the lung. This \ac{cfd} analysis permits a simulation of the airflow \cite{Filipovic2010} and particle deposition in the terminal airways.

\section{Wide Field Synchrotron Radiation Based X-ray Tomographic Microscopy}
The \ac{wf-srxtm} results presented in \autoref{ch:haberthuer2010} make it possible to image much larger lung samples than with conventional \ac{srxtm}. Prior to the presented \ac{wf-srxtm} scanning method, obtaining tomographic datasets of entire acini in the lung relied on luck, with the increase in field of view tomographic images of full acini in the terminal airways can be routinely obtained. 

Studying the changes in the acini over the lung development is one of the underlying questions which can be answered with this new method. Using classic image processing methods like segmentation of airspaces and calculating their volume we can study acinar growth and changes in the distribution of alveolar size (as show in \autoref{fig:DTFplots}) over lung development. These questions are of great biological interest, since changes in the configuration of the terminal airways occurring through changes in acinar size influence airflow as well as particle deposition in the lung. The growth behavior of the alveoli over the duration of the postnatal lung development can be studied using \ac{wf-srxtm}, even permitting to analyze the growth behavior at different locations in the lung, \eg close to the pleural region or deep inside the lung, close to the larger conducting airways.

Since the results presented in \autoref{ch:haberthuer2010} almost exclusively focus on the engineering and technical background of the method, I would like to highlight biological results achieved applying \ac{wf-srxtm} on rat lung samples in the following sections of this chapter instead of an additional discussion of the technical details of the method.

We routinely performed more than 70 \ac{wf-srxtm} scans of different rat lung samples. Using a region growing algorithm multiple independent airway segments have been extracted from those datasets and the structure of these airway segments has been visualized using a skeletonization algorithm built into \href{http://mevislab.de/}{MeVisLab}~\cite{Bitter2007}, the development environment for medical image processing and visualization which I have been using almost exclusively for the analysis and visualization of the tomographic datasets during my work.

\subsection{Skeletonization}
A skeletonization of a structure is performed to extract the underlying information of said structure. The skeleton of a structure corresponds to the local maxima of the distance transformation of this structure, which transforms a binarized image into an image where the gray value of each pixel corresponds to the distance of this pixel to the nearest boundary. \autoref{fig:skeletonization} explains the whole process in a two-dimensional example. An in-depth explanation of the skeletonization algorithm built into MeVisLab is presented by \citet{Selle2002}, an application of the algorithm for the morphometric quantification of vessels is presented by \citet{Boskamp2004}.

MeVisLab can export the information of the skeleton to an \acsu{xml}-file from which we can obtain the amount of skeleton nodes and their position in space for further analysis. The example in \autoref{fig:skeleton} shows a three-dimensional skeletonization of multiple acini in a rat lung sample obtained at postnatal day 21 containing multiple airway segments which each contain one or more acini. Both of these structures are shown in the background. The foreground of the image shows the skeletons of the extracted segment containing between \num{1100} and \num{7300} nodes.

Extracting the four large independent airway segments as shown in \autoref{fig:skeleton} would not have been possible using classic tomography at \ac{tomcat}. Enhancing the field of view of the tomographic scans enabled the visualization of multiple acini in the lung and made additional results possible; a stereological analysis of the \ac{wf-srxtm} datasets is presented in the following section.

\subsection{Stereological analysis of the tomographic data\label{subsec:stereological analysis}}
As mentioned in \autoref{ch:introduction}, the interrelation of the acini in the lung tissue cannot be analyzed using classical sectioning methods, since the three-dimensional information of the airway structure is destroyed during the sectioning process. Applying a region growing method \cite{Zucker1976} on tomographic datasets we were able to study this interrelation of the acini on virtual slices of a rat lung sample scan.

Multiple independent airway segments were extracted from the three-dimensional \ac{wf-srxtm} datasets and were subdivided into single acini using a method named \emph{man hole covering}. The entrances of the acini corresponding to the border between the purely conducting and the gas-exchanging region was identified using morphological criteria like appearance of alveoli in the airway walls and so-called manhole covers have been manually drawn over the tomographic slices. 

\autoref{subfig:manhole-3d} shows a three-dimensional overview of seven acini segmented using this manhole cover method. The red rings show the location of four manhole covers, the other covers are occluded by their respective acinus. \autoref{subfig:manhole-804} and \ref{subfig:manhole-1168} show slices from the original \ac{wf-srxtm} dataset combined with a two-dimensional view of the three-dimensional segmentation shown in \autoref{subfig:manhole-3d}.

	\caption[Manhole cover process]{Manhole cover process for a rat lung sample obtained at postnatal day 4: \subref{subfig:manhole-3d}: Three-dimensional view of seven segmented acini (one not visible). The red rings mark the locations of manually drawn manhole covers, which are not shown for clarity. The covers used to segment the visible acini are hidden by the shown segments. \subref{subfig:manhole-804} and \subref{subfig:manhole-1168}: Slice 804 and 1168 of the \ac{wf-srxtm} dataset (black-and-white  image), combined with the two-dimensional information on the location of the segmented acini (colored regions) shown in panel \subref{subfig:manhole-3d}. Both slices are slightly cropped in horizontal direction. The white square marks the field of view and the semitransparent circle marks the usable region from a classic \ac{srxtm} scan at \ac{tomcat}. The increase in field of view is immediately evident. The regions of the red, cyan, yellow and blue acinus outside the square would not have been detected using a classic scan, but are included in the \ac{wf-srxtm} dataset.}

The white square in the middle of the images shows the field of view of a tomographic image obtained with classical tomography at \ac{tomcat}. The semitransparent white circle marks the region of usable data from a scan with classic field of view. It is clearly visible---even if the sample does not completely fill the field of a \ac{wf-srxtm} scan and could have been bigger---that the usable volume of the tomographic dataset is greatly increased.

Combining the three-dimensional segmentation (colored regions) with the original tomographic slices (black-and-white image) makes it possible to assign alveoli on the two-dimensional slices to the three-dimensional location of the acini and to understand the interrelation of the acini even on the two-dimensional slices. Additionally, it enables the use of these combined images for subsequent stereological analysis.

For the analysis of multiple acini in our lung samples we not only needed to increase the field of view horizontal direction as presented in \autoref{ch:haberthuer2010}, but also in vertical direction. We thus performed a so-called stacked wide field scan, where multiple \ac{wf-srxtm} datasets are sequentially recorded on top of each other, in order to cover an increased field of view in both horizontal and vertical direction. The analysis presented below was performed on such stacked \ac{wf-srxtm} datasets with a size of approximately 3000$\times$3000$\times$3000 voxels at an isometric voxel size of \SI{1.48}{\micro\meter}, \ie a 27-fold increase in visible sample volume as compared to a single classic tomographic scan.

\subsubsection{STEPanizer}\label{sec:stepanizer}
Tomographic data obtained at \ac{tomcat} is inherently isotropic, \ie the voxel have an equal side length and are small cubes. This makes the tomographic data well suited for morphological analysis using a stereological approach, which can be used for the estimation of morphometric parameters of three-dimensional objects based
on measurements made on two-dimensional sections \cite{Vanhecke2007}.

Using tomographic slices of rat lung samples obtained at different postnatal days we assessed the number of alveoli per volume of the segmented acini. Using the aforementioned manhole cover method, several acini have been three-dimensionally extracted and overlaid over the two-dimensional tomographic slices, as shown in \autoref{subfig:manhole-804} and \ref{subfig:manhole-1168}. The volume of the extracted acini shown in \autoref{subfig:manhole-3d} has been calculated according to the amount of contained voxels and their individual volume.

Using a beta-version of the STEPanizer~\cite[available \href{http://stepanizer.com/}{online}]{Tschanz2010}, the number of alveoli per acinar segment has been evaluated. The STEP\-anizer is a simple, web-based tool for manual stereological assessment of digital images developed by Dr.\ Stefan Tschanz at our institute. The beta-version of the STEPanizer with enabled disector---which according to \citet{Hsia2010} enables accurate measuring of alveolar number and volume---was used to count the appearance or disappearance of septal bridges in the tomographic datasets. A physical disector consists of two parallel histological sections generated a known distance apart from the same tissue block. An optical disector is generated by focusing a known distance through the z-plane of a thick section; \eg parallel focal planes using high numerical aperture microscopy objectives, confocal microscopy or tomographic imaging~\cite{Hsia2010}\graffito{Since tomographic images are inherently a stack of slices with a known distance to each other, adjacent slices can be used for disector-type analysis.}.

Counting these septal bridges correctly estimates the number of alveolar entrance rings which in terms corresponds to the number of alveoli in the volume. Details on the counting process have been described by \citet{Hyde2004} and \citet{Ochs2004}.

Using the number of bridges and the volume of the alveolar segments, the alveoli per volume have been plotted as shown in \autoref{fig:alveoli per volume plot}. A statistically significant increase of the alveolar number per volume is observed from day four until postnatal day 21. Beginning with day 21 until day 60 we detected a significant decrease in alveolar number per volume.

We were able to show that applying a well-described stereological method, the optical disector \cite{Sterio1984,Hsia2010} to tomographic data yields the results closely comparable to results obtained from classic histological sections. Lilian Salm, a master student in our group used a computer assisted stereological toolbox (newCAST, \href{http://visiopharm.com/}{Visiopharm A/S}, Hoersholm, Denmark) to the alveolar numbers on samples comparable to the samples shown in \autoref{fig:alveoli per volume plot}; the obtained results from tomographic data and classic histological slices lie within their respective standard deviation (Personal communication; Lilian assessed the alveolar number per total lung volume).

The stereological evaluation of parameters on tomographic data offers an increased insight into the structure of the lung. Using classic histological sections a correct assignment of the different alveoli to their appropriate acinus is not possible while a three-dimensional region growing segmentation of the acini makes this task easily feasible. Not only is an unrestricted three-dimensional view of the resulting segments possible, but further analyses can be carried out on the exported two-dimensional slices.
