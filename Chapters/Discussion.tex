The tomographic data obtained at the beamline for \ac{tomcat} offers an unmatched three-dimensional insight into the mammalian lung. Even if images of the terminal airway ends with higher resolution than the ones obtained at \ac{tomcat} have been obtained with \ac{em}\todo{citation}, it is impossible to visualize the larger three-dimensional structure of the terminal airway ends inside the lung using \ac{em} since the sample has to be sectioned prior to this method.

Tomography in contrast offers a non-destructive insight into the lung, tomographic microscopy using \ac{uct} enables the study of the major airways of swine~\cite{Litzlbauer2006}, rat \todo{citation} or mice lung~\cite{Langheinrich2004} and while \ac{srxtm} and \ac{wf-srxtm} enable the study of the functional lung units of the lung, the so-called acini with unmatched resolution and precision.

In this work three imaging methods based on ultrahigh resolution tomographic data of the terminal airway have been presented, the following sections discuss the major notable points of each of them.

\section{Multimodal Imaging}
The method presented in chapter~\ref{ch:xrm2008} combinines the advantages of tomographic imaging and \ac{em} into a multimodal imaging approach for the analysis of inhaled particles in the lung. The tomographic data provides the unhindered three-dimensional information on the location of sub-micron particles in the terminal airway tree which is combined with the extremely high resolution of the detected particles for the precise analysis of those particles in the lung tissue.

Exposure to ultra-fine particles and nanoparticles produces by environmental or industrial sources is an important health problem. It is expected that inhaled particles are deposited in specific locations in the lung. With currently available methods, the exact location of these deposition sites cannot easily be analyzed. 

Classic histological sections analyzed using light and electron microscopy allow for a precise location of the inhaled particles in relation to the tissue, \ie make it possible to analyze the interaction of the particles with alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells~\cite{Muhlfeld2008}. But the precise localization of these interaction sites inside the airway tree are impossible to extract using histological sections since the three-dimensional structure of the sample is destroyed.

Registration of classic histological slices with the three-dimensional data obtained through \ac{srxtm} make it possible to localize sites of interaction along the airway tree inside the three-dimensional structure of the terminal airways. The method presented in chapter~\ref{ch:xrm2008} was only little more than a proof of concept in terms of the registration between the two imaging modalities. Careful alignment of the sample prior to physical sectioning made registration straightforward, since the images only needed to be corrected for rotation and translation to be able correlate between a physical slice imaged using \ac{em} and a virtual slice of the \ac{srxtm} dataset.

Figure~\ref{fig:correlation} shows the three-dimensional situation of different alignment situations of the two multimodal datasets. The situation shown in figure~\ref{subfig:correlation-planar} can be achieved through careful alignment of the sample prior to histological sectioning and corresponds to the situation presented in chapter~\ref{ch:xrm2008}. Figures~\ref{subfig:correlation-arbitrary1} and \ref{subfig:correlation-arbitrary3} depict situations where the two datasets are arbitrarily orientated with one or multiple degrees of rotation, respectively.

Current work in our group focuses on an automatic registration method taking into account all six degrees of freedom \ie rotation and translation in the x, y and z-plane. First results have already been presented as a Master Thesis by Sébastien \citet{Barre2009}. Fully unrestricted three-dimensional information on the airway three from one imaging modality can be matched with highest resolution two-dimensional information about the particle location in or around the tissue in the lung\todo{what else can we discuss here?}.

\section{Finite Element}
The results presented in chapter~\ref{ch:tsuda2008} focus more on the structural analysis of the gas-exchange region of the lung. The alveolar structure of the pulmonary acinus plays a vital role in gas exchange function. Using an analytical method which mapped a \ac{fe} representation of the terminal airways over a three-dimensional reconstruction of a \ac{srxtm} dataset we accurately reconstructed the gas exchange regions of the lung in three dimensions.

To our knowledge it has never before been possible to three-dimensionally analyze the structure-function relationship of the parenchymal region of the lung in such detail. \citet{Berend1991} performed an analysis of the peripheral region of one human lung using serial sections studied by light microscopy. They were able to analyze the structure of one partical acinus through formidable effort and stated that the process proved to be very difficult and time consuming. \citet{Litzlbauer2006} analyzed porcine lungs using \ac{uct} but suggested to favor \ac{srxtm} over \ac{uct} to enhance the quality of morphometric analysis of the terminal airway structure.

Using \ac{srxtm} it has been not only been possible to visualize the alveolar region of rat lung samples, but also to assess and match morphological parameters of the computed three-dimensional reconstruction to prior stereologically assessed parameters of these lungs.

Since the reconstructed datasets have been directly elementarized using a \ac{fe} mesh lung tissue and air space were not only three-dimensionally visualized, but also immediately prepared for further analysis of the terminal airway region. different morphological parameters were assessed and additionally the \ac{fe} meshing also prepared the resulting dataset for subsequent \ac{cfd} analysis of the airflow in the lung~\todo{moar?}.
