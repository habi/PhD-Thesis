# PhD-Thesis

This is my PhD-Thesis, typeset with [LaTeX][] based on the [classicthesis][] theme by  [André Miede][miede].

The progress of writing the thesis was tracked using SVN and has been migrated to GitHub for safe-keeping after I finished my work at the [Institute of Anatomy][ana] of the [University of Bern][unibe] in Switzerland.

The thesis contains four parts:

1. Introduction
  - An overview over the mammalian lung development
  - An explanation of the most important concepts in computed tomography and an overview of the [TOMCAT beamline][tomcat] at the Swiss Light Source at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland
2. Publications (which were re-typeset from their original sources for integration into the thesis)
  - [A proceeding written for the 9th International Conference on X-Ray Microscopy in Zürich, Switzerland][xrm]
  - [A paper published in the Journal of Applied Physiology][jap]
  - [A paper published in the Journal of Synchrotron Radiation][jsr].
3. Discussion and Outlook
4. Back Matter
  - Curriculum Vitae
  - Bibliography
  - necessary documents for the Graduate School for Cellular and Biomedical Sciences.

A low resolution PDF of the final result is available [here][] (3.4 MB).
